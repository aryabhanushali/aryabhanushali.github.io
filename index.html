        <p>
            Hi! I‚Äôm a Computer Science major at Georgia Tech, specializing in artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction with a minor in cognitive computing. I‚Äôm passionate about applying AI to real-world challenges, especially in healthcare, where technology can make a real difference in people‚Äôs lives. I‚Äôm also fascinated by brain-inspired AI and love exploring how neuroscience can help us build systems that are more adaptive, intuitive, and human-centered. My goal is to create technology that not only solves problems but also pushes the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible.

                            <p>
                                This project explores how face-selective neurons work in a brain-inspired deep neural network (TopoNets).
                                Using the <a href="https://github.com/aryabhanushali/faceSelectiveNeuronExperiment" target="_blank">experiment</a> notebook <code>(faceSelectiveNeuronsExperiment.ipynb)</code>,
                                I identify which neurons respond most strongly to face images, measure how selective they are compared to other image types, and test if they are necessary for accurate face recognition.
                                To simulate prosopagnosia (face blindness), I performed lesion experiments where face-selective neurons were ‚Äúzeroed out‚Äù to see how much the network‚Äôs accuracy on face tasks drops.
                                I also compared neuron activations on face, scene, and object datasets, ran PCA to study how much variance the neurons explain, and used Torch-Dreams to visualize what kind of image patterns maximally activate them.

                data-description="This project implements a particle filter in Python to help a robot localize itself in a noisy environment. The system generates many small hypotheses (particles) about the robot‚Äôs position, updates them based on movement and sensor measurements, and adds realistic noise to simulate uncertainty. Core scripts like particle_filter.py manage the creation, motion updates, and measurement updates of the particles, while utils.py provides essential helper functions such as adding Gaussian noise and rotating points. Together, these modules allow the robot to improve its estimate of its location over time, similar to how a person navigates using a map and surroundings. The project uses Python with NumPy and emphasizes probabilistic robotics and state estimation."
