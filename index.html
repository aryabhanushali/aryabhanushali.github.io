        <p>
            Hi! I’m an upcoming third-year Computer Science major at Georgia Tech, specializing in artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction.
            Check out my <a href="#projects" class="inline-link">projects</a> to see what I’m building and my <a href="#blog" class="inline-link">blog</a> to see what I’m learning!

            data-description="I created this personal portfolio website from scratch to showcase my projects, technical skills, and growth as a developer. My goal was to have a dedicated space online to highlight my work, reflect my style, and practice frontend development without relying on templates. The site features smooth navigation, section transitions, a particle-based neural network animation, interactive project cards with expand/collapse logic, and a fully responsive layout. I also used GitHub for version control and deployment, hosting the site on GitHub Pages to make it publicly accessible. It’s built entirely with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, demonstrating my ability to design and implement user-friendly, polished web interfaces."

        data-description="As part of a collaborative team project, we built a custom Spotify Wrapped experience that pulls data from the Spotify API and uses an LLM chatbot for interactive music insights. We followed an agile workflow, using Git and GitHub for version control, and split responsibilities across backend, frontend, and integration tasks. The app lets users log in, analyze their listening data, and receive engaging summaries powered by a language model chatbot. This project strengthened my teamwork, API integration, and full-stack development skills."

 <div class="card" data-description="One of my earliest hands-on projects, this system was built during the COVID-19 pandemic to explore how programming could address real-world healthcare challenges. Designed to automate patient intake, track appointments, and screen for COVID-19 symptoms, it allowed patients to check in or register through an interactive GUI and flagged high-risk cases with a testing recommendation. This was my first experience applying technical skills to create a meaningful, real-life tool, and it sparked my early interest in healthcare-focused technology."

Using object-oriented design, it includes an abstract healthRecord class and concrete subclasses for pathology and medical history. It handles patient attributes, calculates age and BMI, manages billing, and determines deceased status based on medical indicators. This project showcases inheritance, method overriding, and real-world healthcare modeling with Java classes and date manipulation." data-video="">

     data-description="This was one of my earliest C programming projects, where I built a simple hangman game using structures and file I/O. The game asks for the player’s name, tracks the round number and score, and lets the player guess the letters of the hidden word. It updates the display after each guess and saves the final game stats to a text file. This project taught me core C concepts like arrays, loops, conditionals, structures, and working with external files, and sparked my interest in using code to create interactive, game-like experiences."
