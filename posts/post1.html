                Ever since I started coding, I’ve loved the feeling of solving a new problem, building something from scratch, and then stepping back to ask, “What did I just learn?” This blog is my little corner of the internet to capture the breakthroughs, the bug battles, the patterns I notice, and the things I’m excited to explore next.
            </p>
            <p>
                I built this blog from the ground up using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, no templates, no frameworks. Just a lot of trial and error. It was the perfect chance to practice my frontend skills and incorporate my own designs. From the layout and animations to the navigation and responsiveness, everything here was crafted with intention (and plenty of caffeine).
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the goals was to make the blog lightweight and simple: each post is just a clean HTML file, making it fast and easy to maintain. I also integrated the blog into my personal portfolio to keep everything in one place.
