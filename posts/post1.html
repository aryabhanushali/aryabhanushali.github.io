                I created this blog as a space to document my learning journey, share insights from my projects, and connect with others who are passionate about AI, neuroscience, and human-centered design.
            </p>
            <p>
                Building the blog was a hands-on exercise in frontend development. I designed and coded it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without relying on pre-made templates. This gave me full control over the layout, animations, and overall user experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the goals was to make the blog lightweight and simple — each post is just a clean HTML file, making it fast and easy to maintain. I also integrated the blog into my personal portfolio to keep everything in one place.
