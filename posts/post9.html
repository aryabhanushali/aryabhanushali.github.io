    <h1>Agentic AI, LangChain, and AI Workflows</h1>

        <p>
            Lately, I’ve been exploring the difference between basic AI workflows and what people are now calling <strong>Agentic AI</strong>. Understanding that distinction, and tools like <strong>LangChain</strong> that help bring it to life, has opened up a whole new way of thinking about how AI systems can behave and their capabilities.
        </p>

        <p><strong>AI Workflow vs. Agentic AI</strong></p>
        <p>
            In a traditional AI workflow, you send a prompt to a model and get a response. There is a human decision-maker. Maybe you validate or transform that response using some rules or structure. It’s linear, predictable, and controlled, useful for well-defined tasks like extracting data or answering a direct question.
        </p>

        <p>
            Agentic AI, on the other hand, goes a step further. It involves systems that can <em>decide</em> what to do based on a goal. So now an LLM is the decision-maker that reasons. These systems use language models not just to generate responses, but to plan steps, choose tools, act, and adapt to feedback.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Enter LangChain</strong></p>
        <p>
            LangChain is a powerful framework that makes it easier to build these kinds of agentic systems. It connects large language models (like GPT-4) to tools, APIs, memory, and document retrievers. With LangChain, you’re not just prompting a model, you’re building a thinking system.
        </p>

        <p>
            I’ve been learning how LangChain allows you to:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Build retrieval-augmented pipelines that ground LLMs in external knowledge</li>
            <li>Create custom tools that the model can use dynamically</li>
            <li>Add memory to retain context across steps or sessions</li>
            <li>Construct agents that reason through complex, multi-step goals</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Why This Matters</strong></p>
        <p>
            The shift from prompt engineering to agent design feels like a natural evolution in AI development. It’s not just about getting better responses, but now getting better steps in the first place.
