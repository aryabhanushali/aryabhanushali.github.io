            <p>
                My first week at Elevance Health has been packed with learning. I dove deep into how modern AI tools deliver structured outputs, not just text, but JSON objects with defined schemas. This post walks through the three core technologies I explored: <strong>Pydantic</strong>, <strong>tool calling</strong>, and <strong>structured output from OpenAI's models</strong>.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Pydantic: The Backbone of Data Validation</strong></p>
            <p>
                I started by learning <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev" target="_blank">Pydantic</a>, a Python library for defining and validating data models. It felt like a mix of type hints and real-world safety nets. With Pydantic, I could create classes that automatically enforce structure and types in my data:
            </p>

<pre><code>from pydantic import BaseModel

class Invoice(BaseModel):
    vendor: str
    amount: float
    due_date: str
</code></pre>

            <p>
                Instead of writing endless if-statements to check if a field exists or is the right type, Pydantic just raises an error if anything is wrong. Clean, simple, and powerful.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Tool Calling with OpenAI</strong></p>
            <p>
                Next, I learned how to use OpenAI's <code>tool_calling</code> interface. The idea is to let the language model trigger specific functions based on user input, imagine a chatbot automatically calling your <code>get_invoice_summary()</code> or <code>check_contract_terms()</code> function when you ask it a relevant question.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here's a simplified view of what tool calling looks like:
            </p>

<pre><code>{
  "tool_call": {
    "name": "check_invoice",
    "arguments": {
      "vendor": "ACME Corp",
      "amount": 3200.50
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

            <p>
                What amazed me is how natural the interaction feels — the model "knows" when to call tools based on the conversation, and it passes arguments in structured JSON.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Structured JSON Output from LLMs</strong></p>
            <p>
                Finally, I experimented with generating structured responses using OpenAI’s <code>response_format="json"</code> setting. This allowed me to build AI workflows that are not just "chatty," but directly usable by code. For example, getting a response like this:
            </p>

<pre><code>{
  "invoice_flagged": true,
  "reason": "Amount exceeds contract limit by 15%"
}
</code></pre>

            <p>
                That kind of output is gold when building systems that connect AI with business logic, no extra parsing or guesswork needed.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Final thoughts</strong></p>
            <p>
                This week shifted my perspective on LLMs from "text generators" to "structured reasoning engines." Pydantic gave me tools to validate real-world data, tool calling made AI interactive and responsive, and structured JSON output turned LLMs into collaborators that can slot cleanly into any pipeline.
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm excited to keep building, and automating, more workflows in the weeks to come.
