        <h1>Building a Neural Network From Scratch</h1>

                Neural networks used to feel like magic to me. I’d watch them predict, classify, and generate things and think, "How does this actually work?" I wanted to break through that abstraction and understand every piece of how they function, not just use them, but build one myself.
            </p>
            <p>
                That curiosity led me to create my very first neural network from scratch, no PyTorch, no TensorFlow. Just Python and NumPy. I wanted to get a feel for how forward passes, backward propagation, gradients, and optimization actually play out under the hood.
            </p>
            <p>
                I worked with a minimal deep learning library called <strong>MicroTorch</strong>, which helped me focus on the fundamentals while still allowing for experimentation. I built my own layers, activation functions, loss functions, and optimizers, and trained the network on simple datasets to see how it learned over time.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of my favorite moments? Watching the loss curve drop for the first time and realizing, “Wait, it’s actually learning!”
            </p>
            <p>
                This project really helped me develop an intuition for what’s going on inside a neural net. And now that I’ve done it by hand, I appreciate the frameworks we use daily so much more, because I finally understand the machinery they abstract away.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you're learning neural networks too, I highly recommend trying to build one yourself, even a tiny one. It might be frustrating at first, but it’s such a rewarding way to connect the dots.
