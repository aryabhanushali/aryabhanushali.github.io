            <p>
                After learning about the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), I became curious about how frequency-based ideas show up in real-world systems. One of the most common and clever applications is JPEG image compression, something we interact with every day without realizing how much math is behind it.
            </p>

            <p><strong>How computers represent images</strong></p>
            <p>
                A digital image is a grid of pixels, and each pixel stores three values for red, green, and blue, ranging from 0 to 255. Each channel is 8 bits, or 1 byte, which means one pixel takes up 3 bytes. For a 1000×1000 image, that’s about 3 million bytes, or 3MB. JPEG helps reduce that size significantly without ruining the visual quality.
            </p>

            <p><strong>What JPEG does and why it works</strong></p>
            <p>
                JPEG uses lossy compression: it deliberately throws away some information to reduce file size, but does so in a way that most people can't perceive. Instead of working directly with RGB, JPEG converts the image into the YCbCr color space, which separates brightness (Y) from color (Cb and Cr). Since human vision is more sensitive to brightness than color, JPEG reduces detail in the color channels using a technique called chroma subsampling.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Images as signals and the role of the DCT</strong></p>
            <p>
                Like with the DFT, JPEG treats images as signals. It divides the image into 8×8 pixel blocks and applies the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to each block. This converts 64 pixel values into 64 frequency coefficients. The top-left value, called the DC term, represents the average brightness. The rest are AC terms, representing details and texture.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Energy compaction in action</strong></p>
            <p>
                Most of the important visual information in a block is concentrated in the low-frequency coefficients. JPEG takes advantage of this by keeping the low frequencies and discarding or reducing the precision of the high ones. This is known as energy compaction, and it helps compress the image efficiently while preserving quality.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Quantization: simplifying the data</strong></p>
            <p>
                After the DCT, JPEG applies quantization. This involves dividing each coefficient by a number from a quantization matrix and rounding the result. High-frequency coefficients, which are less visually important, are rounded more aggressively. This step introduces loss, but it’s carefully designed to target details we are less likely to notice.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Lossless compression techniques</strong></p>
            <p>
                JPEG then applies lossless methods to further reduce file size. These include:
                <br><strong>Run-Length Encoding (RLE):</strong> which stores repeated zeros as value-count pairs.
                <br><strong>Huffman Encoding:</strong> which assigns shorter binary codes to frequent values and longer codes to rare ones.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Reconstructing the image</strong></p>
            <p>
                To display a JPEG image, the process is reversed:
                <br>1. The file is decoded using Huffman and RLE decoding.
                <br>2. The quantized coefficients are scaled back using the quantization matrix.
                <br>3. The inverse DCT is applied to each block to return to pixel values.
                <br>4. All the blocks are combined to reconstruct the image.
            </p>

            <p>
                While some fine details are lost, the image remains visually close to the original. That’s what makes JPEG so powerful: it discards what we don’t need, keeps what we do, and makes image storage far more efficient.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Final thoughts</strong></p>
            <p>
                Understanding how JPEG works deepened my appreciation for image processing. It’s a system that blends signal processing, perception, and clever compression algorithms. Concepts like energy compaction and DCT are more than theoretical — they’re the reason your vacation photos load fast and look great, even after being compressed.
