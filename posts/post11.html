        <h1>Mapping the Mind to Models: Why I Built the Brain-AI Mapper</h1>

                I’ve always been excited by finding connections between different fields, especially when it comes to understanding intelligence. My fascination with artificial intelligence (AI) and neuroscience has led me to explore how these two domains can inform and enhance each other. This curiosity was sparked by the parallels between the human brain and artificial intelligence. What if we could build better AI by learning directly from how the brain works? And what if we could also use AI to understand the brain itself? These questions led me to build the Brain-AI Mapper—a web app that visually connects brain regions to the AI models they’ve inspired.

            <p><strong>Why I built this</strong></p>
            <p>
                Honestly, in the beginning of this project I was just looking for a way to combine my two interests: AI and the brain. Usually, we study AI and neuroscience in isolation, even though the most transformative models in deep learning—like convolutional neural networks and transformers—are directly or indirectly inspired by how humans perceive, reason, and learn. I wanted to make something that bridges this gap and helps people see the deep interconnection between cognitive systems and artificial ones.

            <p>
                I also wanted to make this intuitive and educational. When people ask how the brain relates to AI, it’s usually answered with vague metaphors. But I believe we need more grounded, accessible, and interactive tools that show the mappings directly. That’s what the Brain-AI Mapper aims to do.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Why this matters for the future of AI</strong></p>
            <p>
                The future of AI can’t be shaped by engineering alone. As models become more powerful, we need to ground them in human-centered principles—ones informed by neuroscience, cognitive psychology, and ethical reasoning. The brain offers a blueprint for systems that are robust, flexible, embodied, and aligned with human behavior.
            </p>
            <p>
                Brain-inspired AI has already given us breakthroughs like convolutional nets (vision), transformers (attention and memory), and reinforcement learning (planning and reward). But we’ve barely scratched the surface. I believe the next wave of models—especially those used in healthcare, education, and safety-critical fields—must reflect deeper cognitive and ethical structures. That includes understanding things like social reasoning, emotion, and context sensitivity—all things our brains handle naturally.
